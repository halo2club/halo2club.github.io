# 0. learning and contributing
*a living archive of beginner-friendly resources and tutorials; developer communities; and ways to contribute to the project.*
## learning resources
- the [halo2 book](https://github.com/zcash/halo2) is the canonical guide to the original `zcash/halo2`, including:
    - a description of circuit-level abstractions, such as chips and FloorPlanners;
    - a description of the protocol and underlying primitives; and
    - a security proof of the protocol.
- the [0xPARC `halo2` learning group](http://learn.0xparc.org/halo2/) consists of workshops, guest lectures, and hands-on exercises, including:
    - [icemelon/halo2-tutorial](https://github.com/icemelon/halo2-tutorial)
- [circuit FAQ page](./circuit_faqs.md): commonly asked questions collated from the `halo2` ecosystem Discord; most helpful for circuit writers.
- [adria0/awesome-halo2](https://github.com/adria0/awesome-halo2): a community-maintained list of halo2-related resources.

## developer communities
- the [`halo2` ecosystem Discord](https://discord.gg/NxUHAw8rGu) is where we ask questions, find collaborators, and discuss everything `halo2`. we also have a weekly Office Hours (Wed, UTC 1700) on the Discord.
- Axiom hosts a regular [Open-Source Program](https://www.axiom.xyz/open-source-v2), where participants learn to build primitives and applications starting from minimal background.

## contributing
- implement a request from the list of [feature requests](https://github.com/zcash/halo2/labels/C-feature-request) on `zcash/halo2`
- we are testing out a `nightly -> beta -> stable` [feature development workflow](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/dev/features.html).
    - see a list of proposed nightly features [here](https://github.com/zcash/halo2/labels/F-nightly).
