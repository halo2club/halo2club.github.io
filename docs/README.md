[halo2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2) is a zero-knowledge proof system developed by the team at [ECC](https://electriccoin.co/). building on the original implementation, the `halo2` community has grown into an ecosystem of projects, developer tools, and educational resources.

**this page is a directory of projects and resources related to `halo2` and its many variants, for newcomers and frequent contributors alike.** if you notice any missing links, please [open an issue / PR](https://github.com/halo2club/halo2club.github.io) to add them!

## 0. [learning and contributing](./0_learning_contributing.md)
a living archive of beginner-friendly resources and tutorials; developer communities; and ways to contribute to `halo2`.

## 1. [developer tooling and libraries](./1_dev_tooling_libraries.md)
`halo2` has benefited from an incredible range of community-built developer tooling, including domain-specific languages; primitives and libraries; and formal methods.

## 2. [proof system modifications](./2_proof_system_modifications.md)
the original `zcash/halo2` consists of:
- an **optimising system** compatible with UltraPlonK arithmetisation;
- the UltraPlonK **interactive oracle proof**; and
- the inner product argument, used as a **polynomial commitment scheme**.

popular forks of `halo2` have incorporated *proof system modifications* across the stack, at the levels of arithmetisation, interactive oracle proof, and polynomial commitment scheme.

## 3. [interoperability and standardisation](./3_interop_standards.md)
`halo2` is one of many zero-knowledge proof systems in production: our community is keen to support interoperability and standardisation efforts across proof systems.

## 4. [projects](./4_projects.md)
`halo2` has been used in some weird and wonderful circuits, including: private transfers, proof of solvency, coprocessors, machine learning models, virtual machines, zk-email, Wordle, and more.
